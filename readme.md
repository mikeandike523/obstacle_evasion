Welcome to my 2D obstacle evasion demo!

This program has only been tested on windows.
To run the program (windows), simply clone the repo and double click run.bat. pygame will be installed if not already installed.
python must be installed with "py" command, and the "pip3 install" command must be available.



Move your mouse around in the simulation window. You will see that one of the moving objects seeks to create a path to your mouse cursor while evading the other moving objects in the simulation.
